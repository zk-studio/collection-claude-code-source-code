## 🔥🔥🔥 News (Pacific Time)


- Apr 06, 2026 (**v3.05.5**): **Project renamed from Nano Claude Code to ClawSpring**
  - The project has been rebranded from **Nano Claude Code** to **ClawSpring** — a more distinctive name that captures the spirit of the tool: a sharp, agile coding assistant. The `Cl` in ClawSpring is a subtle nod to Claude.
  - CLI command: `nano_claude` → `clawspring`
  - PyPI package: `nano-claude-code` → `clawspring`
  - Config directory: `~/.nano_claude/` → `~/.clawnest/` → `~/.clawspring/`
  - Main entry point: `nano_claude.py` → `clawspring.py`
  - All documentation, GitHub URLs, and internal references updated accordingly.
  - Added **ClawSpring vs OpenClaw** comparison section to README.

- 00.29 PM, Apr 06, 2026 (**v3.05.5**): **SSJ Developer Mode, Telegram Bridge, Worker Command, and UX improvements**
  - **`/ssj` — SSJ Developer Mode**: Interactive power menu with 10 workflow options: Brainstorm, TODO viewer, Worker, Expert Debate, Propose Improvements, Code Review, README generator, Commit helper, Git Diff Scan, and Idea-to-Tasks Promotion. Menu stays open between actions and supports `/command` passthrough (e.g. `/exit` works from inside SSJ).
  - **`/worker` command**: Auto-implements pending tasks from `brainstorm_outputs/todo_list.txt` one by one. Supports selecting specific tasks with comma-separated numbers (e.g. `1,4,6`), a custom todo file path (`--path /other/todo.md`), and a worker count limit (`--workers 3`). If you accidentally pass a brainstorm `.md` output file, Worker detects it and offers to redirect to `todo_list.txt` — or to generate it first from the brainstorm file and then run Worker automatically. Each task gets a dedicated prompt that reads code, implements the change, and marks it done.
  - **`/telegram` — Telegram Bot Bridge**: Receives messages via Telegram Bot API and routes them through the model, sending responses back to the chat. Auto-starts on launch if configured. Only responds to the authorized `chat_id`. Supports slash command passthrough (`/cost`, `/model`, etc.), shows a typing indicator while the model processes, and can be stopped remotely by sending `/stop` in Telegram.
  - **Brainstorm → TODO pipeline**: After brainstorm synthesis, automatically generates `brainstorm_outputs/todo_list.txt` with prioritized checkbox tasks. TODO viewer (SSJ option 2) shows only pending tasks as numbered (completed tasks shown with ✓ without a number).
  - **Expert Debate improvements**: SSJ option 4 now prompts for the number of debate agents (default 2, minimum 2); rounds are auto-calculated as `(agents × 2 − 1)`. The debate result is saved to the same directory as the debated file (`<stem>_debate_HHMMSS.md`). An animated per-round per-expert spinner (`⚔️ Round 2/3 — Expert 1 thinking...`) keeps the terminal lively throughout the debate.
  - **Brainstorm spinner**: Animated spinner with random phrases while brainstorm agents are thinking.
  - **Force quit**: 3× Ctrl+C within 2 seconds triggers `os._exit(1)` — kills the process immediately regardless of blocking I/O.
  - **Interactive Ollama Model Picker** — when a request fails with 404 (model not found), clawspring queries the local Ollama API (`/api/tags`) and presents a numbered model selector to switch models and retry without restarting. Cancelling aborts gracefully without crashing the REPL.
  - **Windows file handling** — `_read`, `_write`, and `_edit` in `tools.py` now force UTF-8 encoding and `newline=""`. `_edit` detects pure-CRLF files (every `\n` is part of `\r\n`) and restores line endings after edit; mixed-line-ending files are left as-is to avoid corruption.
  - **/brainstorm command** — `/brainstorm [topic]` runs a multi-persona AI debate. The model first generates N expert personas tailored to the topic (geopolitics → analysts & diplomats; software → architects & engineers; etc.). Agent count is chosen interactively at runtime (2–100, default 5). Results are saved to `brainstorm_outputs/` and synthesized by the main agent. 
  - **Rich Live SSH fix** — Rich's in-place Live streaming is now automatically disabled in SSH sessions (`SSH_CLIENT`/`SSH_TTY` detected) where ANSI cursor-up breaks and causes repeated output lines. Override with `/config rich_live=true/false`.
  - **`threading.RLock`** — replaced `threading.Lock` with `RLock` to support re-entrant calls from brainstorm synthesis and Ollama retry paths.

- 05:39 PM, Apr 05, 2026 (**v3.05.4**): **Reasoning, Rendering, and Packaging Improvements, Enhanced Memory System, Native vision support for local Ollama models, Bracketed Paste Mode, Rich Tab Completion**
  - **Bracketed Paste Mode** — replaced the old timing-based multi-line paste detection with the standard terminal Bracketed Paste Mode protocol. Pasted text of any length (code blocks, long prompts, multi-paragraph instructions) is now collected as a single turn with zero latency and no blank-line artifacts. Falls back to a 60 ms timing window for terminals that don't support BPM. Bracketed paste mode is cleanly disabled on REPL exit.
  - **Rich Tab Completion with descriptions** — pressing Tab after `/` now shows every command with a one-line description and a hint of its subcommands. Typing `/plugin ` then Tab lists all subcommands (`install`, `uninstall`, `enable`, …). Auto-completes to the unique match when only one command matches the prefix. Subcommands supported for `/mcp`, `/plugin`, `/tasks`, `/cloudsave`, `/voice`, `/permissions`, `/proactive`, and `/memory`.
  - **Model name bug fix** — `--model ollama/qwen3.5:35b` no longer gets corrupted to `ollama/qwen3.5/35b`. The startup colon-to-slash conversion now only fires when the left side of `:` is a known provider name and no `/` is already present, preserving Ollama's `model:tag` format.
  - **Native vision support for local Ollama models** (`llava`, `gemma4`, `llama3.2-vision`): new `/image [prompt]` command captures the current clipboard image, encodes it to Base64, and attaches it to the next prompt. Install Pillow with `pip install clawspring[vision]`; Linux users also need `xclip` (`sudo apt install xclip`).
  - **Enhanced Memory System** — added `confidence` / `source` / `last_used_at` / `conflict_group` metadata to every memory entry; conflict detection on `MemorySave` warns before overwriting; `MemorySearch` re-ranks results by `confidence × recency` (30-day decay) and updates `last_used_at` on hits; new `/memory consolidate` command runs a lightweight AI analysis of the current session and auto-saves up to 3 long-term insights (user preferences, feedback corrections, project decisions) at 0.8 confidence — never overwrites higher-confidence user memories.
  - **Post-merge fixes** — removed a debug `debug_payload.json` file write that was firing on every OpenAI-compatible API call (left over from PR #11 development). Also fixed ANSI dim color not being reset after the thinking block ends, which caused subsequent text to appear dim in non-Rich terminals. Bumped `pyproject.toml` version to `3.05.4`, and moved `sounddevice` to the optional `voice` extra (`pip install clawspring[voice]`).
  - **Native Ollama reasoning + terminal rendering fix** — local reasoning models (`deepseek-r1`, `qwen3`, `gemma4`) now stream their `<think>` blocks to the terminal. Ollama exposes thoughts in `msg["thinking"]`, but clawspring was previously dropping them; this is now fixed by yielding `ThinkingChunk` from the Ollama adapter. Also fixed a Windows CMD/PowerShell rendering issue where token-by-token ANSI dim resets caused thoughts to print vertically, and corrected `flush_response()` so it runs once at the end instead of on every thinking token. Enable with `/verbose` and `/thinking`.
  - **uv support** — added `pyproject.toml`; install with `uv tool install .` to make the `clawspring` command available globally from anywhere in an isolated environment, without manual PATH setup.
- 00:41 PM, Apr 05, 2026: **v3.05.3 add structured session history** — Structured session history: on every exit, sessions are saved to `daily/YYYY-MM-DD/` (capped at `session_daily_limit`, default 5 per day) and appended to a master `history.json` (capped at `session_history_limit`, default 100). Each session file now includes `session_id` and `saved_at` metadata. `/load` groups sessions by date with time, ID, and turn-count display; supports multi-select (`1,2,3`) to merge sessions and `H` to load the full history with token-count confirmation. Both limits are configurable via `/config`.
- 00:41 PM, Apr 05, 2026: **v3.05.3 fix session** — Structured session history: on every exit, sessions are saved to `daily/YYYY-MM-DD/` (capped at `session_daily_limit`, default 5 per day) and appended to a master `history.json` (capped at `session_history_limit`, default 100). Each session file now includes `session_id` and `saved_at` metadata. `/load` groups sessions by date with time, ID, and turn-count display; supports multi-select (`1,2,3`) to merge sessions and `H` to load the full history with token-count confirmation. Both limits are configurable via `/config`.
- 09:34 AM, Apr 05, 2026: **v3.05.3** — Added GitHub Gist cloud sync: `/cloudsave setup <token>` to configure, `/cloudsave` to upload the current session to a private Gist, `/cloudsave auto on` to sync automatically on `/exit`, `/cloudsave list` to browse cloud sessions, and `/cloudsave load <id>` to restore from the cloud. Uses stdlib `urllib` — no new dependencies. Also added version number (e.g., `v3.05.2`) in the startup banner: The startup banner now displays the current version number (v3.05.2) in green, making it easy to identify which version is running at a glance.
- 08:58 AM, Apr 05, 2026: **v3.05.2** — Introduced `/proactive [duration]` command: a background daemon thread watches for user inactivity and automatically wakes the agent up after the specified interval (e.g. `/proactive 5m`), enabling continuous monitoring loops without user intervention. `/proactive` with no args now shows current status; `/proactive off` disables it explicitly. Proactive polling state is stored in `config` (no module-level globals). Watcher exceptions are logged via `traceback` instead of silently swallowed. Also fixed duplicated output in Rich-enabled terminals by buffering text during streaming and rendering Markdown once via `rich.live.Live` — updates happen in-place for a true streaming Markdown experience. 
- 10:51 PM, Apr 04, 2026: **v3.05_fix04** — Fixed a crash on `/model` and config save commands caused by the newly introduced `_run_query_callback` being serialized to JSON; also added `SleepTimer` usage    
  guidance to the system prompt so the agent knows when to invoke background timers proactively.
- 10:28 PM, Apr 04, 2026: **v3.05_fix03** — Added a native `SleepTimer` tool that lets the agent schedule background timers and autonomously wake itself up after a delay — no user prompt required. Paired with a `threading.Lock` to prevent output collisions when background and foreground calls overlap. Also includes cross-platform fixes: Windows ANSI color support, CRLF-aware Edit tool matching, an interactive numbered menu for `/load`, native Ollama streaming via `/api/chat`, and auto-capping `max_tokens` per provider to prevent API errors. 
- 08:31 PM, Apr 04, 2026: **v3.05_fix** — Autosave + `/resume`: session is automatically saved to `mr_sessions/session_latest.json` on `/exit`, `/quit`, `Ctrl+C`, and `Ctrl+D`. Run `/resume` to restore the last session instantly, or `/resume <file>` to load a specific file from `mr_sessions/`, and better support for api and local Ollama models (specifically gemma4), along with Windows compatibility enhancements, session management UX improvements, and cross-platform reliability fixes for the Edit tool.
- 00:41 AM, Apr 04, 2026: **v3.05** — Voice input (`voice/` package): `sounddevice` → `arecord` → SoX recording backends, `faster-whisper` → `openai-whisper` → OpenAI API STT backends. Smart keyterm extraction from git branch + project name + recent files passed as Whisper `initial_prompt` for coding-domain accuracy. `/voice`, `/voice status`, `/voice lang <code>` REPL commands. Works fully offline with no API key. 29 new tests (**~11.6K** lines of Python).
- 10:29 PM, Apr 03, 2026: **v3.04** — Expanded tool coverage: `NotebookEdit` (edit Jupyter `.ipynb` cells — replace/insert/delete with full JSON round-trip) and `GetDiagnostics` (LSP-style diagnostics via pyright/mypy/flake8/tsc/shellcheck). Also fixed a pre-existing schema-index bug in `_register_builtins` by switching to name-based lookup (**~10.5K** lines of Python).
- 06:00 PM, Apr 03, 2026: **v3.03** — Task management system (`task/` package): `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskGet` / `TaskList` tools with sequential IDs, dependency edges (blocks/blocked_by), metadata, persistence to `.clawspring/tasks.json`, thread-safe store, `/tasks` REPL command, 37 new tests (**~9500** lines of Python).
- 02:50 PM, Apr 03, 2026: **v3.02** — Plugin system (`plugin/` package): install/uninstall/enable/disable/update via `/plugin` CLI, recommendation engine (keyword+tag matching), multi-scope (user/project), git-based marketplace. `AskUserQuestion` tool: interactive mid-task user prompts with numbered options and free-text input (**~8500** lines of Python).
- 10:00 AM, Apr 03, 2026: **v3.01** — MCP (Model Context Protocol) support: `mcp/` package, stdio + SSE + HTTP transports, auto tool discovery, `/mcp` command, 34 new tests (**~7000** lines of Python).
- 12:20 PM, Apr 02, 2026: **v3.0** — Multi-agent packages (`multi_agent/`), memory package (`memory/`), skill package (`skill/`) with built-in skills, argument substitution, fork/inline execution, AI memory search, git worktree isolation, agent type definitions (**~5000** lines of Python), see [update](https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/clawspring/blob/main/docs/update_readme_v3.0.md).
- 10:00 AM, Apr 02, 2026: **v2.0** — Context compression, memory, sub-agents, skills, diff view, tool plugin system (**~3400** lines of Python Code).
- 01:47 PM, Apr 01, 2026: Support VLLM inference (**~2000** lines of Python Code).
- 11:30 AM, Apr 01, 2026: Support more **closed-source** models and **open-source models**: Claude, GPT, Gemini, Kimi, Qwen, Zhipu, DeepSeek, and local open-source models via Ollama or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. (**~1700** lines of Python Code).
- 09:50 AM, Apr 01, 2026: Support more **closed-source** models: Claude, GPT, Gemini. (**~1300** lines of Python Code).
- 08:23 AM, Apr 01, 2026: Release the initial version of ClawSpring (**~900 lines** of Python Code).

## Why ClawSpring

Claude Code is a powerful, production-grade AI coding assistant — but its source code is a compiled, 12 MB TypeScript/Node.js bundle (~1,300 files, ~283K lines). It is tightly coupled to the Anthropic API, hard to modify, and impossible to run against a local or alternative model.

**ClawSpring** reimplements the same core loop in ~10K lines of readable Python, keeping everything you need and dropping what you don't. See here for more detailed analysis (ClawSpring v3.03), [English version](https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/clawspring/blob/main/docs/comparison_claude_code_vs_nano_v3.03_en.md) and [Chinese version](https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/clawspring/blob/main/docs/comparison_claude_code_vs_nano_v3.03_cn.md)

### At a glance

| Dimension | Claude Code (TypeScript) | ClawSpring (Python) |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Language | TypeScript + React/Ink | Python 3.8+ |
| Source files | ~1,332 TS/TSX files | 51 Python files |
| Lines of code | ~283K | ~12K |
| Built-in tools | 44+ | 25 |
| Slash commands | 88 | 23 |
| Voice input | Proprietary Anthropic WebSocket (OAuth required) | Local Whisper / OpenAI API — works offline, no subscription |
| Model providers | Anthropic only | 7+ (Anthropic · OpenAI · Gemini · Kimi · Qwen · DeepSeek · Ollama · …) |
| Local models | No | Yes — Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| Build step required | Yes (Bun + esbuild) | No — run directly with `python clawspring.py` (or install to use `clawspring`) |
| Runtime extensibility | Closed (compile-time) | Open — `register_tool()` at runtime, Markdown skills, git plugins |
| Task dependency graph | No | Yes — `blocks` / `blocked_by` edges in `task/` package |

### Where Claude Code wins

- **UI quality** — React/Ink component tree with streaming rendering, fine-grained diff visualization, and dialog systems.
- **Tool breadth** — 44 tools including `RemoteTrigger`, `EnterWorktree`, and more UI-integrated tools.
- **Enterprise features** — MDM-managed config, team permission sync, OAuth, keychain storage, GrowthBook feature flags.
- **AI-driven memory extraction** — `extractMemories` service proactively extracts knowledge from conversations without explicit tool calls.
- **Production reliability** — single distributable `cli.js`, comprehensive test coverage, version-locked releases.

### Where ClawSpring wins

- **Multi-provider** — switch between Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek, Qwen, or a local Llama model with `--model` or `/model` — no recompile needed.
- **Local model support** — run entirely offline with Ollama, LM Studio, or any vLLM-hosted model.
- **Readable source** — the full agent loop is 174 lines (`agent.py`). Any Python developer can read, fork, and extend it in minutes.
- **Zero build** — `pip install -r requirements.txt` and you're running. Changes take effect immediately.
- **Dynamic extensibility** — register new tools at runtime with `register_tool(ToolDef(...))`, install skill packs from git URLs, or wire in any MCP server.
- **Task dependency graph** — `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` support `blocks` / `blocked_by` edges for structured multi-step planning (not available in Claude Code).
- **Two-layer context compression** — rule-based snip + AI summarization, configurable via `preserve_last_n_turns`.
- **Notebook editing** — `NotebookEdit` directly manipulates `.ipynb` JSON (replace/insert/delete cells) with no kernel required.
- **Diagnostics without LSP server** — `GetDiagnostics` chains pyright → mypy → flake8 → py_compile for Python and tsc/shellcheck for other languages, with zero configuration.
- **Offline voice input** — `/voice` records via `sounddevice`/`arecord`/SoX, transcribes with local `faster-whisper` (no API key, no subscription), and auto-submits. Keyterms from your git branch and project files boost coding-term accuracy.
- **Cloud session sync** — `/cloudsave` backs up conversations to private GitHub Gists with zero extra dependencies; restore any past session on any machine with `/cloudsave load <id>`.
- **SSJ Developer Mode** — `/ssj` opens a persistent power menu with 10 workflow shortcuts: Brainstorm → TODO → Worker pipeline, expert debate, code review, README generation, commit helper, and more. Stays open between actions; supports `/command` passthrough.
- **Telegram Bot Bridge** — `/telegram <token> <chat_id>` turns clawspring into a Telegram bot: receive user messages, run the model, and send back responses — all from your phone. Slash commands pass through, and a typing indicator keeps the chat feeling live.
- **Worker command** — `/worker` auto-implements pending tasks from `brainstorm_outputs/todo_list.txt`, marks each one done after completion, and supports task selection by number (e.g. `1,4,6`).
- **Force quit** — 3× Ctrl+C within 2 seconds triggers immediate `os._exit(1)`, unblocking any frozen I/O.
- **Proactive background monitoring** — `/proactive 5m` activates a sentinel daemon that wakes the agent automatically after a period of inactivity, enabling continuous monitoring loops, scheduled checks, or trading bots without user prompts.
- **Rich Live streaming rendering** — When `rich` is installed, responses stream as live-updating Markdown in place (no duplicate raw text), with clean tool-call interleaving.
- **Native Ollama reasoning** — Local reasoning models (deepseek-r1, qwen3, gemma4) stream their `<think>` tokens directly to the terminal via `ThinkingChunk` events; enable with `/verbose` and `/thinking`.
- **Native Ollama vision** — `/image [prompt]` captures the clipboard and sends it to local vision models (llava, gemma4, llama3.2-vision) via Ollama's native image API. No cloud required.
- **Reliable multi-line paste** — Bracketed Paste Mode (`ESC[?2004h`) collects any pasted text — code blocks, multi-paragraph prompts, long diffs — as a single turn with zero latency and no blank-line artifacts.
- **Rich Tab completion** — Tab after `/` shows all commands with one-line descriptions and subcommand hints; subcommand Tab-complete works for `/mcp`, `/plugin`, `/tasks`, `/cloudsave`, and more.

## ClawSpring vs OpenClaw

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is another popular open-source AI assistant built on TypeScript/Node.js. The two projects have **different primary goals** — here is how they compare.

### At a glance

| Dimension | OpenClaw (TypeScript) | ClawSpring (Python) |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Language | TypeScript + Node.js | Python 3.8+ |
| Source files | ~10,349 TS/JS files | 51 Python files |
| Lines of code | ~245K | ~12K |
| Primary focus | Personal life assistant across messaging channels | AI **coding** assistant / developer tool |
| Architecture | Always-on Gateway daemon + companion apps | Zero-install terminal REPL |
| Messaging channels | 20+ (WhatsApp · Telegram · Slack · Discord · Signal · iMessage · Matrix · WeChat · …) | Terminal + optional Telegram bridge |
| Model providers | Multiple (cloud-first) | 7+ including full local support (Ollama · vLLM · LM Studio · …) |
| Local / offline models | Limited | Full — Ollama, vLLM, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| Voice | Wake word · PTT · Talk Mode (macOS/iOS/Android) | Offline Whisper STT (local, no API key) |
| Code editing tools | Browser control, Canvas workspace | Read · Write · Edit · Bash · Glob · Grep · NotebookEdit · GetDiagnostics |
| Build step required | Yes (`pnpm install` + daemon setup) | No — `pip install` and run |
| Mobile companion | macOS menu bar + iOS/Android apps | — |
| Live Canvas / UI | Yes (A2UI agent-driven visual workspace) | — |
| MCP support | — | Yes (stdio/SSE/HTTP) |
| Runtime extensibility | Skills platform (bundled/managed/workspace) | `register_tool()` at runtime, MCP, git plugins, Markdown skills |
| Hackability | Large codebase (245K lines), harder to modify | ~12K lines — full agent loop visible in one file |

### Where OpenClaw wins

- **Omni-channel inbox** — connects to 20+ messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage, Discord, Teams, Matrix, WeChat…); users interact from wherever they already are.
- **Always-on daemon** — Gateway runs as a background service (launchd/systemd); no terminal required for day-to-day use.
- **Mobile-first** — macOS menu bar, iOS Voice Wake / Talk Mode, Android camera/screen recording — feels like a native app, not a CLI tool.
- **Live Canvas** — agent-driven visual workspace rendered in the browser; supports A2UI push/eval/snapshot.
- **Browser automation** — dedicated Chrome/Chromium profile with snapshot, actions, and upload tools.
- **Production reliability** — versioned npm releases, comprehensive CI, onboarding wizard, `openclaw doctor` diagnostics.

### Where ClawSpring wins

- **Coding toolset** — Read/Write/Edit/Bash/Glob/Grep/NotebookEdit/GetDiagnostics are purpose-built for software development; ClawSpring understands diffs, file trees, and code structure.
- **True local model support** — full Ollama/vLLM/LM Studio integration with streaming, tool-calling, and vision — no cloud required.
- **7+ model providers** — switch between Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, and local models with a single `--model` flag.
- **Hackable in minutes** — 12K lines of readable Python; the entire agent loop is in `agent.py`; extend with `register_tool()` at runtime without rebuilding.
- **Zero setup** — `pip install clawspring` and run `clawspring`; no daemon, no pairing, no onboarding wizard.
- **MCP support** — connect any MCP server (stdio/SSE/HTTP); tools auto-registered.
- **SSJ Developer Mode** — `/ssj` power menu chains Brainstorm → TODO → Worker → Debate in a persistent interactive session; automates entire dev workflows.
- **Offline voice** — `/voice` transcribes locally with `faster-whisper`; no subscription, no OAuth, works without internet.
- **Session cloud sync** — `/cloudsave` backs up full conversations to private GitHub Gists with zero extra dependencies.

### When to choose which

| If you want… | Use |
|---|---|
| A personal assistant you can message on WhatsApp/Signal/Discord | **OpenClaw** |
| An AI coding assistant in your terminal | **ClawSpring** |
| Full offline / local model support | **ClawSpring** |
| A mobile-friendly always-on experience | **OpenClaw** |
| To read and modify the source in an afternoon | **ClawSpring** |
| Browser automation and a visual Canvas | **OpenClaw** |
| Multi-provider LLM switching without rebuilding | **ClawSpring** |

---

### Key design differences

**Agent loop** — ClawSpring uses a Python generator that `yield`s typed events (`TextChunk`, `ToolStart`, `ToolEnd`, `TurnDone`). The entire loop is visible in one file, making it easy to add hooks, custom renderers, or logging.

**Tool registration** — every tool is a `ToolDef(name, schema, func, read_only, concurrent_safe)` dataclass. Any module can call `register_tool()` at import time; MCP servers, plugins, and skills all use the same mechanism.

**Context compression**

| | Claude Code | ClawSpring |
|-|-------------|-----------------|
| Trigger | Exact token count | `len / 3.5` estimate, fires at 70 % |
| Layer 1 | — | Snip: truncate old tool outputs (no API cost) |
| Layer 2 | AI summarization | AI summarization of older turns |
| Control | System-managed | `preserve_last_n_turns` parameter |

**Memory** — Claude Code's `extractMemories` service has the model proactively surface facts. ClawSpring's `memory/` package is tool-driven: the model calls `MemorySave` explicitly, which is more predictable and auditable. Each memory now carries `confidence`, `source`, `last_used_at`, and `conflict_group` metadata; search re-ranks by confidence × recency; and `/memory consolidate` offers a manual consolidation pass without silently modifying memories in the background.

### Who should use ClawSpring

- Developers who want to **use a local or non-Anthropic model** as their coding assistant.
- Researchers studying **how agentic coding assistants work** — the entire system fits in one screen.
- Teams who need a **hackable baseline** to add proprietary tools, custom permission policies, or specialised agent types.
- Anyone who wants Claude Code-style productivity **without a Node.js build chain**.

| Skills | Built-in `/commit` · `/review` + custom markdown skills with argument substitution and fork/inline execution |
| Plugin tools | Register custom tools via `tool_registry.py` |
| Permission system | `auto` / `accept-all` / `manual` modes |
| 19 slash commands | `/model` · `/config` · `/save` · `/cost` · `/memory` · `/skills` · `/agents` · `/voice` · `/proactive` · … |
| Voice input | Record → transcribe → auto-submit. Backends: `sounddevice` / `arecord` / SoX + `faster-whisper` / `openai-whisper` / OpenAI API. Works fully offline. |
| Brainstorm | `/brainstorm [topic]` generates N expert personas suited to the topic (2–100, default 5, chosen interactively), runs an iterative debate, saves results to `brainstorm_outputs/`, and synthesizes a Master Plan + auto-generates `brainstorm_outputs/todo_list.txt`. |
| SSJ Developer Mode | `/ssj` opens a persistent interactive power menu with 10 shortcuts: Brainstorm, TODO viewer, Worker, Expert Debate, Propose, Review, Readme, Commit, Scan, Promote. Stays open between actions; `/command` passthrough supported. Debate shows animated per-round spinner and saves result next to the debated file. |
| Worker | `/worker [task#s]` reads `brainstorm_outputs/todo_list.txt`, implements each pending task with a dedicated model prompt, and marks it done (`- [x]`). Supports task selection (`/worker 1,4,6`), custom path (`--path`), and worker count limit (`--workers`). Detects and redirects accidental brainstorm `.md` paths. |
| Telegram bridge | `/telegram <token> <chat_id>` starts a bot bridge: receive messages from Telegram, run the model, and reply — all from your phone. Typing indicator, slash command passthrough, and auto-start on launch if configured. |
| Vision input | `/image [prompt]` captures the clipboard image and sends it to a local vision model (Ollama `llava`, `gemma4`, `llama3.2-vision`). Requires `pip install clawspring[vision]`; Linux also needs `xclip`. |
| Proactive monitoring | `/proactive [duration]` starts a background sentinel daemon; agent wakes automatically after inactivity, enabling continuous monitoring loops without user prompts |
| Force quit | 3× Ctrl+C within 2 seconds triggers `os._exit(1)` — kills the process immediately regardless of blocking I/O |
| Rich Live streaming | When `rich` is installed, responses render as live-updating Markdown in place. Auto-disabled in SSH sessions to prevent repeated output; override with `/config rich_live=false`. |
| Context injection | Auto-loads `CLAUDE.md`, git status, cwd, persistent memory |
| Session persistence | Autosave on exit to `daily/YYYY-MM-DD/` (per-day limit) + `history.json` (master, all sessions) + `session_latest.json` (/resume); sessions include `session_id` and `saved_at` metadata; `/load` grouped by date |
| Cloud sync | `/cloudsave` syncs sessions to private GitHub Gists; auto-sync on exit; load from cloud by Gist ID. No new dependencies (stdlib `urllib`). |
| Extended Thinking | Toggle on/off for Claude models; native `<think>` block streaming for local Ollama reasoning models (deepseek-r1, qwen3, gemma4) |
| Cost tracking | Token usage + estimated USD cost |
| Non-interactive mode | `--print` flag for scripting / CI |

> **Note:** Tool calling requires a model that supports function calling. Recommended local models: `qwen2.5-coder`, `llama3.3`, `mistral`, `phi4`.

> **Reasoning models:** `deepseek-r1`, `qwen3`, and `gemma4` stream native `<think>` blocks. Enable with `/verbose` and `/thinking` to see thoughts in the terminal. Note: models fed a large system prompt (like clawspring's 25 tool schemas) may suppress their thinking phase to avoid breaking the expected JSON format — this is model behavior, not a bug.

## Installation

### Recommended: install as a global command with `uv`

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installs `clawspring` into an isolated environment and puts it on your PATH so you can run it from anywhere:

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/clawspring
cd clawspring
uv tool install .
```

After that, `clawspring` is available as a global command:

```bash
clawspring                        # start REPL
clawspring --model gpt-4o         # choose a model
clawspring -p "explain this"      # non-interactive
```

To update after pulling new code:

```bash
uv tool install . --reinstall
```

To uninstall:

```bash
uv tool uninstall clawspring
```

### Alternative: run directly from the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/clawspring
cd clawspring

pip install -r requirements.txt
# or manually (sounddevice is optional — only needed for /voice):
pip install anthropic openai httpx rich
pip install sounddevice  # optional: voice input

python clawspring.py
```

---

## Usage: Open-Source Models (Local)

### Option A — Ollama (Recommended)

Ollama runs models locally with zero configuration. No API key required.

**Step 1: Install Ollama**

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Or download from https://ollama.com/download
```

**Step 2: Pull a model**

```bash
# Best for coding (recommended)
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder          # 4.7 GB (7B)
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b      # 19 GB (32B)

# General purpose
ollama pull llama3.3               # 42 GB (70B)
ollama pull llama3.2               # 2.0 GB (3B)

# Reasoning
ollama pull deepseek-r1            # 4.7 GB (7B)
ollama pull deepseek-r1:32b        # 19 GB (32B)

# Other
ollama pull phi4                   # 9.1 GB (14B)
ollama pull mistral                # 4.1 GB (7B)
```

**Step 3: Start Ollama server** (runs automatically on macOS; on Linux run manually)

```bash
ollama serve     # starts on http://localhost:11434
```

**Step 4: Run clawspring**

```bash
clawspring --model ollama/qwen2.5-coder
clawspring --model ollama/llama3.3
clawspring --model ollama/deepseek-r1
```

Or

```bash
python clawspring.py --model ollama/qwen2.5-coder
python clawspring.py --model ollama/llama3.3
python clawspring.py --model ollama/deepseek-r1
python clawspring.py --model ollama/qwen3.5:35b
```

**List your locally available models:**

```bash
ollama list
```

Then use any model from the list:

```bash
clawspring --model ollama/<model-name>
```

---

### Option B — LM Studio

LM Studio provides a GUI to download and run models, with a built-in OpenAI-compatible server.

**Step 1:** Download [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) and install it.

**Step 2:** Search and download a model inside LM Studio (GGUF format).

**Step 3:** Go to **Local Server** tab → click **Start Server** (default port: 1234).

**Step 4:**

```bash
clawspring --model lmstudio/<model-name>
# e.g.:
clawspring --model lmstudio/phi-4-GGUF
clawspring --model lmstudio/qwen2.5-coder-7b
```

The model name should match what LM Studio shows in the server status bar.

---

### Option C — vLLM / Self-Hosted OpenAI-Compatible Server

For self-hosted inference servers (vLLM, TGI, llama.cpp server, etc.) that expose an OpenAI-compatible API:

Quick Start for option C:
Step 1: Start vllm:
 ```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=7 python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
      --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct \
      --host 0.0.0.0 \
      --port 8000 \
      --enable-auto-tool-choice \
      --tool-call-parser hermes
```


 Step 2: Start clawspring：
```
  export CUSTOM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
  export CUSTOM_API_KEY=none
  clawspring --model custom/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct
```


```bash
# Example: vLLM serving Qwen2.5-Coder-32B
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
    --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct \
    --port 8000

# Then run clawspring pointing to your server:
clawspring
```

Inside the REPL:

```
/config custom_base_url=http://localhost:8000/v1
/config custom_api_key=token-abc123    # skip if no auth
/model custom/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct
```

Or set via environment:

```bash
export CUSTOM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
export CUSTOM_API_KEY=token-abc123

clawspring --model custom/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct
```

For a remote GPU server:

```bash
/config custom_base_url=http://192.168.1.100:8000/v1
/model custom/your-model-name
```

---

## Model Name Format

Three equivalent formats are supported:

```bash
# 1. Auto-detect by prefix (works for well-known models)
clawspring --model gpt-4o
clawspring --model gemini-2.0-flash
clawspring --model deepseek-chat

# 2. Explicit provider prefix with slash
clawspring --model ollama/qwen2.5-coder
clawspring --model kimi/moonshot-v1-128k

# 3. Explicit provider prefix with colon (also works)
clawspring --model kimi:moonshot-v1-32k
clawspring --model qwen:qwen-max
```

**Auto-detection rules:**

| Model prefix | Detected provider |
|---|---|
| `claude-` | anthropic |
| `gpt-`, `o1`, `o3` | openai |
| `gemini-` | gemini |
| `moonshot-`, `kimi-` | kimi |
| `qwen`, `qwq-` | qwen |
| `glm-` | zhipu |
| `deepseek-` | deepseek |
| `llama`, `mistral`, `phi`, `gemma`, `mixtral`, `codellama` | ollama |

---

## Configuring API Keys

### Method 1: Environment Variables (recommended)

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...
export MOONSHOT_API_KEY=sk-...       # Kimi
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-...      # Qwen
export ZHIPU_API_KEY=...             # Zhipu GLM
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...       # DeepSeek
```

### Method 2: Set Inside the REPL (persisted)

```
/config anthropic_api_key=sk-ant-...
/config openai_api_key=sk-...
/config gemini_api_key=AIza...
/config kimi_api_key=sk-...
/config qwen_api_key=sk-...
/config zhipu_api_key=...
/config deepseek_api_key=sk-...
```

Keys are saved to `~/.clawspring/config.json` and loaded automatically on next launch.

### Method 3: Edit the Config File Directly

```json
// ~/.clawspring/config.json
{
  "model": "qwen/qwen-max",
  "max_tokens": 8192,
  "permission_mode": "auto",
  "verbose": false,
  "thinking": false,
  "qwen_api_key": "sk-...",
  "kimi_api_key": "sk-...",
  "deepseek_api_key": "sk-..."
}
```

## Permission System

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | Read-only operations always allowed. Prompts before Bash commands and file writes. |
| `accept-all` | Never prompts. All operations proceed automatically. |
| `manual` | Prompts before every single operation, including reads. |

**When prompted:**

```
  Allow: Run: git commit -am "fix bug"  [y/N/a(ccept-all)]
```

- `y` — approve this one action
- `n` or Enter — deny
- `a` — approve and switch to `accept-all` for the rest of the session

**Commands always auto-approved in `auto` mode:**
`ls`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `pwd`, `echo`, `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`, `git show`, `find`, `grep`, `rg`, `python`, `node`, `pip show`, `npm list`, and other read-only shell commands.

| `mcp__filesystem__read_file` | `filesystem` server, `read_file` tool |
| `mcp__myserver__my_action` | custom server you configured |

> **Adding custom tools:** See [Architecture Guide](docs/architecture.md#tool-registry) for how to register your own tools.

---

## Memory

The model can remember things across conversations using the built-in memory system.

### Storage

Memories are stored as individual markdown files in two scopes:

| Scope | Path | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| **User** (default) | `~/.clawspring/memory/` | Shared across all projects |
| **Project** | `.clawspring/memory/` in cwd | Local to the current repo |

A `MEMORY.md` index (≤ 200 lines / 25 KB) is auto-rebuilt on every save or delete and injected into the system prompt so the model always has an overview of what's been remembered.

### Memory types

| Type | Use for |
|---|---|
| `user` | Your role, preferences, background |
| `feedback` | How you want the model to behave (corrections AND confirmations) |
| `project` | Ongoing work, deadlines, decisions not in git history |
| `reference` | Links to external systems (Linear, Grafana, Slack, etc.) |

### Memory file format

Each memory is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: coding_style
description: Python formatting preferences
type: feedback
created: 2026-04-02
confidence: 0.95
source: user
last_used_at: 2026-04-05
conflict_group: coding_style
---
Prefer 4-space indentation and full type hints in all Python code.
**Why:** user explicitly stated this preference.
**How to apply:** apply to every Python file written or edited.
```

**Metadata fields** (new — auto-managed):

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `confidence` | `1.0` | Reliability score 0–1. Explicit user statements = 1.0; inferred preferences ≈ 0.8; auto-consolidated ≈ 0.8 |
| `source` | `user` | Origin: `user` / `model` / `tool` / `consolidator` |
| `last_used_at` | — | Updated automatically each time this memory is returned by MemorySearch |
| `conflict_group` | — | Groups related memories (e.g. `writing_style`) for conflict tracking |

### Conflict detection

When `MemorySave` is called with a name that already exists but different content, the system reports the conflict before overwriting:

```
Memory saved: 'writing_style' [feedback/user]
⚠ Replaced conflicting memory (was user-sourced, 100% confidence, written 2026-04-01).
  Old content: Prefer formal, academic style...
```

### Ranked retrieval

`MemorySearch` ranks results by **confidence × recency** (30-day exponential decay) rather than plain keyword order. Memories that haven't been used recently fade in priority. Each search hit also updates `last_used_at` so frequently-accessed memories stay prominent.

```
You: /memory python
  [feedback/user] coding_style [conf:95% src:user]
    Python formatting preferences
    Prefer 4-space indentation and full type hints...
```

### `/memory consolidate` — auto-extract long-term insights

After a meaningful session, run:

```
[myproject] ❯ /memory consolidate
  Analyzing session for long-term memories…
  ✓ Consolidated 2 memory/memories: user_prefers_direct_answers, avoid_trailing_summaries
```

The command sends a condensed session transcript to the model and asks it to identify up to **3** insights worth keeping long-term (user preferences, feedback corrections, project decisions). Extracted memories are saved with `confidence: 0.80` and `source: consolidator` — they **never overwrite** an existing memory that already has higher confidence.

Good times to run `/memory consolidate`:
- After correcting the model's behavior several times in a row
- After a session where you shared project background or decisions
- After completing a task with clear planning choices

### Example interaction

```
You: Remember that I prefer 4-space indentation and type hints.
AI: [calls MemorySave] Memory saved: 'coding_style' [feedback/user]

You: /memory
  1 memory/memories:
  [feedback  |user   ] coding_style.md
    Python formatting preferences

You: /memory python
  Found 1 relevant memory for 'python':
  [feedback/user] coding_style
    Prefer 4-space indentation and full type hints in all Python code.

You: /memory consolidate
  ✓ Consolidated 1 memory: user_prefers_verbose_commit_messages
```

**Staleness warnings:** Memories older than 1 day show a `⚠ stale` caveat — claims about file:line citations or code state may be outdated; verify before acting.

**AI-ranked search:** `MemorySearch(query="...", use_ai=true)` uses the model to rank candidates by relevance before applying the confidence × recency re-ranking.

---

## Skills

Skills are reusable prompt templates that give the model specialized capabilities. Two built-in skills ship out of the box — no setup required.

**Built-in skills:**

| Trigger | Description |
|---|---|
| `/commit` | Review staged changes and create a well-structured git commit |
| `/review [PR]` | Review code or PR diff with structured feedback |

**Quick start — custom skill:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.clawspring/skills
```

Create `~/.clawspring/skills/deploy.md`:

```markdown
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy to an environment
triggers: [/deploy]
allowed-tools: [Bash, Read]
when_to_use: Use when the user wants to deploy a version to an environment.
argument-hint: [env] [version]
arguments: [env, version]
context: inline
---

Deploy $VERSION to the $ENV environment.
Full args: $ARGUMENTS
```

Now use it:

```
You: /deploy staging 2.1.0
AI: [deploys version 2.1.0 to staging]
```

**Argument substitution:**
- `$ARGUMENTS` — the full raw argument string
- `$ARG_NAME` — positional substitution by named argument (first word → first name)
- Missing args become empty strings

**Execution modes:**
- `context: inline` (default) — runs inside current conversation history
- `context: fork` — runs as an isolated sub-agent with fresh history; supports `model` override

**Priority** (highest wins): project-level > user-level > built-in

**List skills:** `/skills` — shows triggers, argument hint, source, and `when_to_use`

**Skill search paths:**

```
./.clawspring/skills/     # project-level (overrides user-level)
~/.clawspring/skills/     # user-level
```

---

## Sub-Agents

The model can spawn independent sub-agents to handle tasks in parallel.

**Specialized agent types** — built-in:

| Type | Optimized for |
|---|---|
| `general-purpose` | Research, exploration, multi-step tasks |
| `coder` | Writing, reading, and modifying code |
| `reviewer` | Security, correctness, and code quality analysis |
| `researcher` | Web search and documentation lookup |
| `tester` | Writing and running tests |

**Basic usage:**
```
You: Search this codebase for all TODO comments and summarize them.
AI: [calls Agent(prompt="...", subagent_type="researcher")]
    Sub-agent reads files, greps for TODOs...
    Result: Found 12 TODOs across 5 files...
```

**Background mode** — spawn without waiting, collect result later:
```
AI: [calls Agent(prompt="run all tests", name="test-runner", wait=false)]
AI: [continues other work...]
AI: [calls CheckAgentResult / SendMessage to follow up]
```

**Git worktree isolation** — agents work on an isolated branch with no conflicts:
```
Agent(prompt="refactor auth module", isolation="worktree")
```
The worktree is auto-cleaned up if no changes were made; otherwise the branch name is reported.

**Custom agent types** — create `~/.clawspring/agents/myagent.md`:
```markdown
---
name: myagent
description: Specialized for X
model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
tools: [Read, Grep, Bash]
---
Extra system prompt for this agent type.
```

**List running agents:** `/agents`

Sub-agents have independent conversation history, share the file system, and are limited to 3 levels of nesting.

---

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP lets you connect any external tool server — local subprocess or remote HTTP — and Claude can use its tools automatically. This is the same protocol Claude Code uses to extend its capabilities.

### Supported transports

| Transport | Config `type` | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **stdio** | `"stdio"` | Spawn a local subprocess (most common) |
| **SSE** | `"sse"` | HTTP Server-Sent Events stream |
| **HTTP** | `"http"` | Streamable HTTP POST (newer servers) |

### Configuration

Place a `.mcp.json` file in your project directory **or** edit `~/.clawspring/mcp.json` for user-wide servers.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "git": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git"]
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-filesystem", "/tmp"]
    },
    "my-remote": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/sse",
      "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer my-token"}
    }
  }
}
```

Config priority: `.mcp.json` (project) overrides `~/.clawspring/mcp.json` (user) by server name.

### Quick start

```bash
# Install a popular MCP server
pip install uv        # uv includes uvx
uvx mcp-server-git --help   # verify it works

# Add to user config via REPL
/mcp add git uvx mcp-server-git

# Or create .mcp.json in your project dir, then:
/mcp reload
```

### REPL commands

```
/mcp                          # list servers + their tools + connection status
/mcp reload                   # reconnect all servers, refresh tool list
/mcp reload git               # reconnect a single server
/mcp add myserver uvx mcp-server-x   # add stdio server
/mcp remove myserver          # remove from user config
```

### How Claude uses MCP tools

Once connected, Claude can call MCP tools directly:

```
You: What files changed in the last git commit?
AI: [calls mcp__git__git_diff_staged()]
    → shows diff output from the git MCP server
```

Tool names follow the pattern `mcp__<server_name>__<tool_name>`. All characters
that are not alphanumeric or `_` are automatically replaced with `_`.

### Popular MCP servers

| Server | Install | Provides |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp-server-git` | `uvx mcp-server-git` | git operations (status, diff, log, commit) |
| `mcp-server-filesystem` | `uvx mcp-server-filesystem <path>` | file read/write/list |
| `mcp-server-fetch` | `uvx mcp-server-fetch` | HTTP fetch tool |
| `mcp-server-postgres` | `uvx mcp-server-postgres <conn-str>` | PostgreSQL queries |
| `mcp-server-sqlite` | `uvx mcp-server-sqlite --db-path x.db` | SQLite queries |
| `mcp-server-brave-search` | `uvx mcp-server-brave-search` | Brave web search |

## Plugin System

The `plugin/` package lets you extend clawspring with additional tools, skills, and MCP servers from git repositories or local directories.

### Install a plugin

```bash
/plugin install my-plugin@https://github.com/user/my-plugin
/plugin install local-plugin@/path/to/local/plugin
```

### Manage plugins

```bash
/plugin                   # list installed plugins
/plugin enable my-plugin  # enable a disabled plugin
/plugin disable my-plugin # disable without uninstalling
/plugin disable-all       # disable all plugins
/plugin update my-plugin  # pull latest from git
/plugin uninstall my-plugin
/plugin info my-plugin    # show manifest details
```

### Plugin recommendation engine

```bash
/plugin recommend                    # auto-detect from project files
/plugin recommend "docker database"  # recommend by keyword context
```

The engine matches your context against a curated marketplace (git-tools, python-linter, docker-tools, sql-tools, test-runner, diagram-tools, aws-tools, web-scraper) using tag and keyword scoring.

### Plugin manifest (plugin.json)

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Does something useful",
  "author": "you",
  "tags": ["git", "python"],
  "tools": ["tools"],        // Python module(s) that export TOOL_DEFS
  "skills": ["skills/my.md"],
  "mcp_servers": {},
  "dependencies": ["httpx"]  // pip packages
}
```

Alternatively use YAML frontmatter in `PLUGIN.md`.

### Scopes

| Scope | Location | Config |
|-------|----------|--------|
| user (default) | `~/.clawspring/plugins/` | `~/.clawspring/plugins.json` |
| project | `.clawspring/plugins/` | `.clawspring/plugins.json` |

Use `--project` flag: `/plugin install name@url --project`

---

## AskUserQuestion Tool

Claude can pause mid-task and interactively ask you a question before proceeding.

**Example invocation by Claude:**
```json
{
  "tool": "AskUserQuestion",
  "question": "Which database should I use?",
  "options": [
    {"label": "SQLite", "description": "Simple, file-based"},
    {"label": "PostgreSQL", "description": "Full-featured, requires server"}
  ],
  "allow_freetext": true
}
```

**What you see in the terminal:**
```
❓ Question from assistant:
   Which database should I use?

  [1] SQLite — Simple, file-based
  [2] PostgreSQL — Full-featured, requires server
  [0] Type a custom answer

Your choice (number or text):
```

- Select by number or type free text directly
- Claude receives your answer and continues the task
- 5-minute timeout (returns "(no answer — timeout)" if unanswered)

---

## Task Management

The `task/` package gives Claude (and you) a structured task list for tracking multi-step work within a session.

### Tools available to Claude

| Tool | Parameters | What it does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| `TaskCreate` | `subject`, `description`, `active_form?`, `metadata?` | Create a task; returns `#id created: subject` |
| `TaskUpdate` | `task_id`, `subject?`, `description?`, `status?`, `owner?`, `add_blocks?`, `add_blocked_by?`, `metadata?` | Update any field; `status='deleted'` removes the task |
| `TaskGet` | `task_id` | Return full details of one task |
| `TaskList` | _(none)_ | List all tasks with status icons and pending blockers |

**Valid statuses:** `pending` → `in_progress` → `completed` / `cancelled` / `deleted`

### Dependency edges

```
TaskUpdate(task_id="3", add_blocked_by=["1","2"])
# Task 3 is now blocked by tasks 1 and 2.
# Reverse edges are set automatically: tasks 1 and 2 get task 3 in their "blocks" list.
```

Completed tasks are treated as resolved — `TaskList` hides their blocking effect on dependents.

### Persistence

Tasks are saved to `.clawspring/tasks.json` in the current working directory after every mutation and reloaded on first access.

### REPL commands

```
/tasks                    list all tasks
/tasks create <subject>   quick-create a task
/tasks start <id>         mark in_progress
/tasks done <id>          mark completed
/tasks cancel <id>        mark cancelled
/tasks delete <id>        remove a task
/tasks get <id>           show full details
/tasks clear              delete all tasks
```

### Typical Claude workflow

```
User: implement the login feature

Claude:
  TaskCreate(subject="Design auth schema", description="JWT vs session")  → #1
  TaskCreate(subject="Write login endpoint", description="POST /auth/login") → #2
  TaskCreate(subject="Write tests", description="Unit + integration") → #3
  TaskUpdate(task_id="2", add_blocked_by=["1"])
  TaskUpdate(task_id="3", add_blocked_by=["2"])

  TaskUpdate(task_id="1", status="in_progress", active_form="Designing schema")
  ... (does the work) ...
  TaskUpdate(task_id="1", status="completed")
  TaskList()  → task 2 is now unblocked
  ...
```

## Voice Input

ClawSpring v3.05 adds a fully offline voice-to-prompt pipeline. Speak your request — it is transcribed and submitted as if you had typed it.

### Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install a recording backend (choose one)
pip install sounddevice        # recommended: cross-platform, no extra binary
# sudo apt install alsa-utils  # Linux arecord fallback
# sudo apt install sox         # SoX rec fallback

# 2. Install a local STT backend (recommended — works offline, no API key)
pip install faster-whisper numpy

# 3. Start ClawSpring and speak
clawspring
[myproject] ❯ /voice
  🎙  Listening… (speak now, auto-stops on silence, Ctrl+C to cancel)
  🎙  ████
✓  Transcribed: "fix the authentication bug in user.py"
[auto-submitting…]
```

### STT backends (tried in order)

| Backend | Install | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `faster-whisper` | `pip install faster-whisper` | **Recommended** — local, offline, fastest, GPU optional |
| `openai-whisper` | `pip install openai-whisper` | Local, offline, original OpenAI model |
| OpenAI Whisper API | set `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Cloud, requires internet + API key |

Override the Whisper model size with `NANO_CLAUDE_WHISPER_MODEL` (default: `base`):

```bash
export NANO_CLAUDE_WHISPER_MODEL=small   # better accuracy, slower
export NANO_CLAUDE_WHISPER_MODEL=tiny    # fastest, lightest
```

### Recording backends (tried in order)

| Backend | Install | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sounddevice` | `pip install sounddevice` | **Recommended** — cross-platform, Python-native |
| `arecord` | `sudo apt install alsa-utils` | Linux ALSA, no pip needed |
| `sox rec` | `sudo apt install sox` / `brew install sox` | Built-in silence detection |

### Keyterm boosting

Before each recording, ClawSpring extracts coding vocabulary from:
- **Git branch** (e.g. `feat/voice-input` → "feat", "voice", "input")
- **Project root name** (e.g. "clawspring")
- **Recent source file stems** (e.g. `authentication_handler.py` → "authentication", "handler")
- **Global coding terms**: `MCP`, `grep`, `TypeScript`, `OAuth`, `regex`, `gRPC`, …

These are passed as Whisper's `initial_prompt` so the STT engine prefers correct spellings of coding terms.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/voice` | Record voice and auto-submit the transcript as your next prompt |
| `/voice status` | Show which recording and STT backends are available |
| `/voice lang <code>` | Set transcription language (`en`, `zh`, `ja`, `de`, `fr`, … default: `auto`) |

### How it compares to Claude Code

| | Claude Code | ClawSpring v3.05 |
|---|---|---|
| STT service | Anthropic private WebSocket (`voice_stream`) | `faster-whisper` / `openai-whisper` / OpenAI API |
| Requires Anthropic OAuth | Yes | **No** |
| Works offline | No | **Yes** (with local Whisper) |
| Keyterm hints | Deepgram `keyterms` param | Whisper `initial_prompt` (git + files + vocab) |
| Language support | Server-allowlisted codes | Any language Whisper supports |

## Brainstorm

`/brainstorm` runs a structured multi-persona AI debate over your project, then synthesizes all perspectives into an actionable plan.

### How it works

1. **Context snapshot** — reads `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and root file listing from the current working directory.
2. **Agent count** — you are prompted to choose how many agents (2–100, default 5). Press Enter to use the default.
3. **Dynamic persona generation** — the model generates N expert roles tailored to your topic. Software topics get architects and engineers; geopolitics gets analysts, diplomats, and economists; business gets strategists and market experts. Falls back to built-in tech personas if generation fails.
4. **Agents debate sequentially**, each building on the previous responses.
5. **Output saved** to `brainstorm_outputs/brainstorm_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` in the current directory.
6. **Synthesis** — the main agent reads the saved file and produces a prioritized Master Plan.

**Example personas by topic:**

| Topic | Example Generated Personas |
|---|---|
| Software architecture | 🏗️ Architect · 💡 Product Innovator · 🛡️ Security Engineer · 🔧 Code Quality Lead · ⚡ Performance Specialist |
| US-Iran geopolitics | 🌍 Geopolitical Analyst · ⚖️ International Law Expert · 💰 Energy Economist · 🎖️ Military Strategist · 🕊️ Conflict Mediator |
| Business strategy | 📈 Market Strategist · 💼 Operations Lead · 🔍 Competitive Intelligence · 💡 Innovation Director · 📊 Financial Analyst |

### Usage

```
[myproject] ❯ /brainstorm
  How many agents? (2-100, default 5) > 5

[myproject] ❯ /brainstorm improve plugin architecture
  How many agents? (2-100, default 5) > 3

[myproject] ❯ /brainstorm US-Iran geopolitics
  How many agents? (2-100, default 5) > 7
```

### Example output

```
[myproject] ❯ /brainstorm medical research funding
  How many agents? (2-100, default 5) > 3
Generating 3 topic-appropriate expert personas...
Starting 3-Agent Brainstorming Session on: medical research funding

✓  Brainstorming complete! Results saved to brainstorm_outputs/brainstorm_20260405_224117.md

   ── Analysis from Main Agent ──
[synthesized Master Plan streams here…]
```

### Notes

- Brainstorm uses the **currently selected model** (`/model` to check). A capable model (Claude Sonnet/Opus, GPT-4o, or a large local model) gives the best results.
- With many agents (20+) the session can take several minutes depending on model speed.
- Install `faker` (`pip install faker`) for randomized persona names; falls back to built-in names otherwise.
- Output files accumulate in `brainstorm_outputs/` — already added to `.gitignore` by v3.05.5.
- If output looks garbled in SSH (repeated lines), run `/config rich_live=false` to disable Rich Live streaming.

  ⚡ SSJ » 1
  Topic (Enter for general): clawspring plugin system

  # → Brainstorm spins up, saves to brainstorm_outputs/, generates todo_list.txt
  # → Menu re-opens automatically after each action

  ⚡ SSJ » 2
  # → Shows numbered pending tasks from brainstorm_outputs/todo_list.txt

  ⚡ SSJ » 3
  Task # (Enter for all, or e.g. 1,4,6): 2
  # → Worker implements task #2 and marks it done
```

### Slash command passthrough

Any `/command` typed at the `⚡ SSJ »` prompt is passed through to the REPL:

```
  ⚡ SSJ » /model gpt-4o
  # → switches model, then re-opens SSJ menu

  ⚡ SSJ » /exit
  # → exits clawspring immediately
```

### Worker command

`/worker` (also accessible as SSJ option 3) reads `brainstorm_outputs/todo_list.txt` and auto-implements each pending task:

```
[myproject] ❯ /worker
  ✓ Worker starting — 3 task(s) to implement
    1. ○ Add animated brainstorm spinner
    2. ○ Implement Telegram typing indicator
    3. ○ Write SSJ demo GIF for README

  ── Worker (1/3): Add animated brainstorm spinner ──
  [model reads code, implements the change, marks task done]

[myproject] ❯ /worker 2,3
  # Implement only tasks 2 and 3

[myproject] ❯ /worker --path docs/tasks.md
  # Use a custom todo file

[myproject] ❯ /worker --workers 2
  # Process only the first 2 pending tasks this run
```

**Smart path detection** — if you pass a brainstorm output file (`.md`) by mistake, Worker detects it and offers to redirect to the matching `todo_list.txt` in the same folder. If that file does not yet exist, it offers to generate `todo_list.txt` from the brainstorm output first (SSJ Promote), then run Worker automatically.

### Debate command

SSJ option 4 runs a structured multi-round expert debate on any file:

```
  ⚡ SSJ » 4

  Files in brainstorm_outputs/:
    1. brainstorm_20260406_143022.md

```

- Agent count is configurable (minimum 2, default 2). Rounds are set to `agents × 2 − 1` for a full open-close structure.
- An animated spinner shows the current round and expert (`⚔️ Round 2/3 — Expert 1 thinking...`), stopping the moment that expert starts outputting.
- The full debate transcript and ranked consensus are saved to `<filename>_debate_HHMMSS.md` **in the same directory as the debated file**.

## Telegram Bridge

`/telegram` turns clawspring into a Telegram bot — receive messages from your phone, run the model with full tool access, and reply automatically.

<div align=center>
<img src="https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/clawspring/blob/main/docs/telegram_demo.gif" width="850"/>
</div>

### Setup (one-time)

1. Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) in Telegram → `/newbot` → copy the token.
2. Send any message to your new bot, then open `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` and note your `chat.id`.
3. Configure clawspring:

```
[myproject] ❯ /telegram <your_bot_token> <your_chat_id>
  ✓ Telegram config saved.
  ✓ Connected to @your_bot_name. Starting bridge...
  ✓ Telegram bridge active. Chat ID: 123456789
  ℹ Send messages to your bot — they'll be processed here.
  ℹ Stop with /telegram stop or send /stop in Telegram.
```

Token and chat_id are saved to `~/.clawspring/config.json`. On next launch the bridge **auto-starts** if configured — the startup banner shows `flags: [telegram]`.

### How it works

```
Phone (Telegram)                  clawspring terminal
──────────────────                ──────────────────────────
"List Python files"      →        📩 Telegram: List Python files
                                  [typing indicator sent...]
                                  ⚙ Glob(**/*.py) → 5 files
                                  ⚙ response assembled
                          ←       "agent.py, tools.py, ..."
```

- **Typing indicator** is sent every 4 seconds while the model processes, so the chat feels responsive.
- **Unauthorized senders** receive `⛔ Unauthorized.` and their messages are dropped.
- **Slash command passthrough**: send `/cost`, `/model gpt-4o`, `/clear`, etc. from Telegram and they execute in clawspring.
- **`/stop` or `/off`** sent from Telegram stops the bridge gracefully.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/telegram <token> <chat_id>` | Configure token + chat_id, then start the bridge |
| `/telegram` | Start the bridge using saved config |
| `/telegram status` | Show running state and chat_id |
| `/telegram stop` | Stop the bridge |

### Auto-start

If both `telegram_token` and `telegram_chat_id` are set in `~/.clawspring/config.json`, the bridge starts automatically on every clawspring launch:

```
╭─ ClawSpring ────────────────────────────────╮
│  Model:       claude-opus-4-6
│  Permissions: auto   flags: [telegram]
│  Type /help for commands, Ctrl+C to cancel        │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
✓ Telegram bridge started (auto). Bot: @your_bot_name
```

## Proactive Background Monitoring

ClawSpring v3.05.2 adds a **sentinel daemon** that automatically wakes the agent after a configurable period of inactivity — no user prompt required. This enables use cases like continuous log monitoring, market script polling, or scheduled code checks.

### Quick start

```
[myproject] ❯ /proactive 5m
Proactive background polling: ON  (triggering every 300s of inactivity)

[myproject] ❯ keep monitoring the build log and alert me if errors appear

╭─ Claude ● ─────────────────────────
│ Understood. I'll check the build log each time I wake up.

[Background Event Triggered]
╭─ Claude ● ─────────────────────────
│ ⚙ Bash(tail -50 build.log)
│ ✓ → Build failed: ImportError in auth.py line 42
│ **Action needed:** fix the import before the next CI run.
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/proactive` | Show current status (ON/OFF and interval) |
| `/proactive 5m` | Enable — trigger every 5 minutes of inactivity |
| `/proactive 30s` | Enable — trigger every 30 seconds |
| `/proactive 1h` | Enable — trigger every hour |
| `/proactive off` | Disable sentinel polling |

Duration suffix: `s` = seconds, `m` = minutes, `h` = hours. Plain integer = seconds.

### How it works

- A background daemon thread starts when the REPL launches (paused by default).
- The daemon checks elapsed time since the last user or agent interaction every second.
- When the inactivity threshold is reached, it calls the agent with a wake-up prompt.
- The `threading.Lock` used by the main agent loop ensures wake-ups never interrupt an active session — they queue and fire after the current turn completes.
- Watcher exceptions are logged via `traceback` so failures are visible and debuggable.

### Complements SleepTimer

| | `SleepTimer` | `/proactive` |
|---|---|---|
| Who initiates | The agent | The user |
| Trigger | After a fixed delay from now | After N seconds of inactivity |
| Use case | "Check back in 10 minutes" | "Keep watching until I stop typing" |

## Context Compression

Long conversations are automatically compressed to stay within the model's context window.

**Two layers:**

1. **Snip** — Old tool outputs (file reads, bash results) are truncated after a few turns. Fast, no API cost.
2. **Auto-compact** — When token usage exceeds 70% of the context limit, older messages are summarized by the model into a concise recap.

This happens transparently. You don't need to do anything.

---

## Diff View

When the model edits or overwrites a file, you see a git-style diff:

```diff
  Changes applied to config.py:

--- a/config.py
+++ b/config.py
@@ -12,7 +12,7 @@
     "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
-    "max_tokens": 8192,
+    "max_tokens": 16384,
     "permission_mode": "auto",
```

Green lines = added, red lines = removed. New file creations show a summary instead.

---

## CLAUDE.md Support

Place a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project to give the model persistent context about your codebase. ClawSpring automatically finds and injects it into the system prompt.

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md          # Global — applies to all projects
/your/project/CLAUDE.md      # Project-level — found by walking up from cwd
```

**Example `CLAUDE.md`:**

```markdown
# Project: FastAPI Backend

## Stack
- Python 3.12, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Alembic
- Tests: pytest, coverage target 90%

## Conventions
- Format with black, lint with ruff
- Full type annotations required
- New endpoints must have corresponding tests

## Important Notes
- Never hard-code credentials — use environment variables
- Do not modify existing Alembic migration files
- The `staging` branch deploys automatically to staging on push
```

---

## Session Management

### Storage layout

Every exit automatically saves to three places:

```
~/.clawspring/sessions/
├── history.json                          ← master: all sessions ever (capped)
├── mr_sessions/
│   └── session_latest.json              ← always the most recent (/resume)
└── daily/
    ├── 2026-04-05/
    │   ├── session_110523_a3f9.json     ← per-day files, newest kept
    │   └── session_143022_b7c1.json
    └── 2026-04-04/
        └── session_183100_3b4c.json
```

Each session file includes metadata:

```json
{
  "session_id": "a3f9c1b2",
  "saved_at": "2026-04-05 11:05:23",
  "turn_count": 8,
  "messages": [...]
}
```

### Autosave on exit

Every time you exit — via `/exit`, `/quit`, `Ctrl+C`, or `Ctrl+D` — the session is saved automatically:

```
✓ Session saved → /home/.../.clawspring/sessions/mr_sessions/session_latest.json
✓              → /home/.../.clawspring/sessions/daily/2026-04-05/session_110523_a3f9.json  (id: a3f9c1b2)
✓   history.json: 12 sessions / 87 total turns
```

### Quick resume

To continue where you left off:

```bash
clawspring
[myproject] ❯ /resume
✓  Session loaded from …/mr_sessions/session_latest.json (42 messages)
```

Resume a specific file:

```bash
/resume session_latest.json          # loads from mr_sessions/
/resume /absolute/path/to/file.json  # loads from absolute path
```

### Manual save / load

```bash
/save                          # save with auto-name (session_TIMESTAMP_ID.json)
/save debug_auth_bug           # named save to ~/.clawspring/sessions/

/load                          # interactive list grouped by date
/load debug_auth_bug           # load by filename
```

**`/load` interactive list:**

```
  ── 2026-04-05 ──
  [ 1] 11:05:23  id:a3f9c1b2  turns:8   session_110523_a3f9.json
  [ 2] 09:22:01  id:7e2d4f91  turns:3   session_092201_7e2d.json

  ── 2026-04-04 ──
  [ 3] 22:18:00  id:3b4c5d6e  turns:15  session_221800_3b4c.json

  ── Complete History ──
  [ H] Load ALL history  (3 sessions / 26 total turns)  /home/.../.clawspring/sessions/history.json

  Enter number(s) (e.g. 1 or 1,2,3), H for full history, or Enter to cancel >
```

- Enter a single number to load one session
- Enter comma-separated numbers (e.g. `1,3`) to merge multiple sessions in order
- Enter `H` to load the entire history — shows message count and token estimate before confirming

### Configurable limits

| Config key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `session_daily_limit` | `5` | Max session files kept per day in `daily/` |
| `session_history_limit` | `100` | Max sessions kept in `history.json` |

```bash
/config session_daily_limit=10
/config session_history_limit=200
```

### history.json — full conversation history

`history.json` accumulates every session in one place, making it possible to search your complete conversation history or analyze usage patterns:

```json
{
  "total_turns": 150,
  "sessions": [
    {"session_id": "a3f9c1b2", "saved_at": "2026-04-05 11:05:23", "turn_count": 8, "messages": [...]},
    {"session_id": "7e2d4f91", "saved_at": "2026-04-05 09:22:01", "turn_count": 3, "messages": [...]}
  ]
}
```

---

## Cloud Sync (GitHub Gist)

ClawSpring v3.05.3 adds optional cloud backup of conversation sessions via **GitHub Gist**. Sessions are stored as private Gists (JSON), browsable in the GitHub UI. No extra dependencies — uses Python's stdlib `urllib`.

### Setup (one-time)

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) → **Generate new token (classic)**
2. Enable the **`gist`** scope
3. Copy the token and run:

```
[myproject] ❯ /cloudsave setup ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
✓ GitHub token saved (logged in as: Chauncygu). Cloud sync is ready.
```

### Upload a session

```
[myproject] ❯ /cloudsave
Uploading session to GitHub Gist…
✓ Session uploaded → https://gist.github.com/abc123def456
```

Add an optional description:

```
[myproject] ❯ /cloudsave push auth refactor debug session
```

### Auto-sync on exit

```
[myproject] ❯ /cloudsave auto on
✓ Auto cloud-sync ON — session will be uploaded to Gist on /exit.
```

From that point on, every `/exit` or `/quit` automatically uploads the session before closing.

### Browse and restore

```
[myproject] ❯ /cloudsave list
  Found 3 session(s):
  abc123de…  2026-04-05 11:02  auth refactor debug session
  7f9e12ab…  2026-04-04 22:18  proactive monitoring test
  3b4c5d6e…  2026-04-04 18:31

[myproject] ❯ /cloudsave load abc123de...full-gist-id...
✓ Session loaded from Gist (42 messages).
```

### Commands reference

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/cloudsave setup <token>` | Save GitHub token (needs `gist` scope) |
| `/cloudsave` | Upload current session to a new or existing Gist |
| `/cloudsave push [desc]` | Upload with optional description |
| `/cloudsave auto on\|off` | Toggle auto-upload on exit |
| `/cloudsave list` | List all clawspring Gists |
| `/cloudsave load <gist_id>` | Download and restore a session |

## FAQ

**Q: How do I add an MCP server?**

Option 1 — via REPL (stdio server):
```
/mcp add git uvx mcp-server-git
```

Option 2 — create `.mcp.json` in your project:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "git": {"type": "stdio", "command": "uvx", "args": ["mcp-server-git"]}
  }
}
```

Then run `/mcp reload` or restart. Use `/mcp` to check connection status.

**Q: An MCP server is showing an error. How do I debug it?**

```
/mcp                    # shows error message per server
/mcp reload git         # try reconnecting
```

If the server uses stdio, make sure the command is in your `$PATH`:
```bash
which uvx               # should print a path
uvx mcp-server-git      # run manually to see errors
```

**Q: Can I use MCP servers that require authentication?**

For HTTP/SSE servers with a Bearer token:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-api": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://myserver.example.com/sse",
      "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer sk-my-token"}
    }
  }
}
```

For stdio servers with env-based auth:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brave": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-brave-search"],
      "env": {"BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-key"}
    }
  }
}
```

**Q: Tool calls don't work with my local Ollama model.**

Not all models support function calling. Use one of the recommended tool-calling models: `qwen2.5-coder`, `llama3.3`, `mistral`, or `phi4`.

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder
clawspring --model ollama/qwen2.5-coder
```

**Q: How do I connect to a remote GPU server running vLLM?**

```
/config custom_base_url=http://your-server-ip:8000/v1
/config custom_api_key=your-token
/model custom/your-model-name
```

**Q: How do I check my API cost?**

```
/cost

  Input tokens:  3,421
  Output tokens:   892
  Est. cost:     $0.0648 USD
```

**Q: Can I use multiple API keys in the same session?**

Yes. Set all the keys you need upfront (via env vars or `/config`). Then switch models freely — each call uses the key for the active provider.

**Q: How do I make a model available across all projects?**

Add keys to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`. Set the default model in `~/.clawspring/config.json`:

```json
{ "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6" }
```

**Q: Qwen / Zhipu returns garbled text.**

Ensure your `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` / `ZHIPU_API_KEY` is correct and the account has sufficient quota. Both providers use UTF-8 and handle Chinese well.

**Q: Can I pipe input to clawspring?**

```bash
echo "Explain this file" | clawspring --print --accept-all
cat error.log | clawspring -p "What is causing this error?"
```

**Q: How do I run it as a CLI tool from anywhere?**

Use `uv tool install` — it creates an isolated environment and puts `clawspring` on your PATH:

```bash
cd clawspring
uv tool install .
```

After that, just run `clawspring` from any directory. To update after pulling changes, run `uv tool install . --reinstall`.

**Q: How do I set up voice input?**

```bash
# Minimal setup (local, offline, no API key):
pip install sounddevice faster-whisper numpy

# Then in the REPL:
/voice status          # verify backends are detected
/voice                 # speak your prompt
```

On first use, `faster-whisper` downloads the `base` model (~150 MB) automatically.
Use a larger model for better accuracy: `export NANO_CLAUDE_WHISPER_MODEL=small`

**Q: Voice input transcribes my words wrong (misses coding terms).**

The keyterm booster already injects coding vocabulary from your git branch and project files.
For persistent domain terms, put them in a `.clawspring/voice_keyterms.txt` file (one term per line) — this is checked automatically on each recording.

**Q: Can I use voice input in Chinese / Japanese / other languages?**

Yes. Set the language before recording:

```
/voice lang zh    # Mandarin Chinese
/voice lang ja    # Japanese
/voice lang auto  # reset to auto-detect (default)
```

Whisper supports 99 languages. `auto` detection works well but explicit codes improve accuracy for short utterances.
